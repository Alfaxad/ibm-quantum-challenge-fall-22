We are proud to welcome you back for another bi-annual IBM Quantum Challenge this fall! This time we are taking you through an interactive intergalactic storyline and introducing you to a new programming model for building algorithmic routines - The Qiskit Primitives. Qiskit Primitives showcases two of the currently available primitive constructs: Sampler and Estimator - building on core common algorithmic routines in the domain of Optimization, Chemistry and Machine Learning, while also using them as an interface to explore the offerings of the Qiskit Runtime service.

Starting on Friday, November 11 (9AM EDT), embark with us on an 7-day space journey of learning and exploring the latest cutting edge capabilities of Qiskit and Qiskit Runtime service to help you build on skills and tackle constructing quantum algorithmic routines accommodating a few real life deployment practices. You can read more about the challenge in the [announcement blog](https://www.research.ibm.com/blog/quantum-challenge-fall-2022).

Make sure to join the dedicated Slack channel [#challenge-fall-2022](https://qiskit.slack.com/archives/C0466L7D5CG) where you can connect with mentors and fellow attendees! Join the Qiskit Slack workspace [here](https://ibm.co/joinqiskitslack) if you haven't already. 

Following this challenge, if you are looking to apply your new-found knowledge further, we encourage you to participate in the IBM Open Science Prize that will be announced later this year! Every year, a new technical challenge at the forefront of quantum computing is posed to the entire world and those who generate the strongest solutions can win thousands of dollars in prizes. We hope to see you there too!



## ==================================

### IBM QUANTUM FALL CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION AND SOLUTIONS.

I am glad that I got a chance to solve my 4th IBM Quantum challenge. The Quantum fall 2022 challenge was space themed and contained challenges of ascending difficulty which were: Qiskit Runtime and Primitives, Quantum Machine Learning, Quantum optimization and Quantum chemistry.

#### Lab 1: Qiskit Runtime and Primitives

In Lab 1, our first challenge exercise, you’ll learn how to use primitives in Qiskit Runtime while solving simple exercises using basic quantum circuits. Even if you're completely unfamiliar with Qiskit Runtime, these exercises will give you the background you need to move on to the next challenge. If you want to learn more about Qiskit Runtime before the challenge, check out these tutorials in our Qiskit Runtime documentation.

#### Lab 2: Quantum Machine Learning

For Lab 2, you’ll need to learn the basics of quantum machine learning (QML) to decode your captain’s log and unearth a hidden clue about your mission. You’re likely already familiar with classical machine learning, where we use data mining and algorithmic techniques to generate meaningful insights and predictions from data sets. QML leverages quantum mechanical properties to deliver potential learning improvements over purely classical methods, and with the Qiskit Machine Learning Module, it’s easy to rapidly prototype quantum kernels, quantum neural networks, and other ML models. In this part of the challenge, you’ll learn about data encoding and classical ML methods before exploring quantum kernels and building your own quantum classifier.

#### Lab 3: Quantum Optimization

Lab 3 will put your navigation skills to the test as you explore the fascinating world of quantum optimization. Mathematical optimization techniques play a role in nearly every sector of the global economy — from manufacturing and shipping logistics to engineering and beyond. However, many famous and valuable Read our tutorial on the Max-Cut and Traveling Salesman Problemoptimization problems are intractable to classical computation. In Lab 3, you’ll use optimization algorithms from the Qiskit Optimization Module to do some cosmic clean-up, working out the most fuel-efficient route to eliminate dangerous pieces of space debris before slingshotting your starship out of a sticky situation.

#### Lab 4: Quantum Chemistry

The challenge concludes with an exercise in quantum chemistry simulation, where you’ll discover strange interstellar molecules never before seen on Earth. Chemists have been using classical computation to model and simulate the structure of molecules for decades, but classical simulations of these inherently quantum systems are incredibly computationally expensive. Classical computers can only simulate large molecular systems if they rely on rough approximations, but quantum computers have the potential to simulate these systems much more precisely and efficiently. For this final lab, you’ll use the Qiskit Nature Module to calculate key properties of your mystery molecules, and obtain important information to discover cosmic clouds that may aide in your journey home.

#### Error Suppression and Error Mitigation
In addition to mastering the applications detailed above, you’ll also learn about two techniques that are essential in quantum computing — error mitigation and error suppression. Modern quantum hardware is extremely susceptible to noise and error, which limit system performance by generating incorrect or unexpected outputs. One way to work around these limitations is to apply various error mitigation and suppression techniques, which serve to minimize performance degradation from hardware error. The Fall Challenge will introduce you to some exciting up-and-coming error mitigation and error suppression techniques.
